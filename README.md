# Another large header, just for good measure

Questions to ask before submitting: 
- Do I have to embed a local image file from my computer? Or just a link? How do I do that if so?
    - I bet it's images contained in the directory of images I just made...
- Did I rename all of the files correctly? If not, what should I change?

- This is a list
- With two separate entries
- Who knows, maybe even three
- Wait, is that four? 
- Wow, what a nice list with five whole entries 
1) I can even number my lists 
    - What's that? Nested lists too? 
        - Nestception? 
            - Ok, this is getting a little ridiculous
2) Second number, just to prove I can

### Ok, let's keep track of what I have done with a table

| Done | Not Done |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Make a table | Embed an image  |
| Use headers | Tidy data |
| Embed a link| Finish HW  |
| Make a list| Eat lunch|
